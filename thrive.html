<h2>Thrive App</h2>
<br>
<p><strong>Context & Concept: User Stories</strong><br>
  For this interaction design project, we started off by solving for the following user story:<em> “As a health-conscious Seattleite, I want a way to understand what locally grown produce is in season and where to buy it, so I can eat healthier while supporting local farms and businesses year-round.”</em>
  <br><br>
  We began to sketch out wireframes that would solve for the user’s need to source locally grown produce from grocery stores near her. We quickly identified the distinction between sourcing local produce and purchasing local produce and had to make a decision about the functionality of our app. We decided that our app would simply identify what produce is available at grocery stores near the user, and allow the user to curate a shopping list. 
  <br><br>
  We expanded upon the functionality of our initial wireframes by coming up with two additional user stories. 
  <br><br>
<em>As a user, I want curated meal ideas, so I can make a full meal with local ingredients.
  <br><br>
As a user, I want to get the best price possible for local items, so I can eat ethically and frugally.</em>
  <br><br>
  To create a more robust platform, we identified two user stories that we identified as adjacent issues that users would likely face: wanting to prepare an entire meal with majority locally grown, seasonal ingredients and wanting to find the best deal possible on locally grown, seasonal ingredients. 
  <br><br>
  The app would have a database of inventories from all markets with a credible selection of locally grown, seasonal options in stock. This information would empower the user to make the best selection possible based on proximity to their location or best price. The app would also curate a variety of recipes weekly that would include a minimum of 50 percent in season and locally sourced ingredients. 
  <br><br>
  <strong>User Testing</strong><br>
  Through user testing, we identified several opportunities for improvement in the search by location flow and the search by lowest price flow. In the former, users were immediately confused by the presence of search results before they ever input their location. This screen incorrectly told the user that the app was using geo-tracking to know their current location and automatically pull the nearest stores. This told us we had work to do in clarifying this interaction. Regarding the search by lowest price flow, users overlooked the filter bar entirely and spent too long in a state of confusion. Once they were able to find the filter, they were further confused by both the percentage discount bug and the slashed price—the users would have preferred one or the other so that they could quickly identify the best deals.
